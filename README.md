# plot_small_HZ_planets
Plots of small HZ planets and how their parameters have changed with new data

This repository compares DR25 planet parameters for 30 small confirmed planets with updated planet parameters from Gaia and E. Mamajek. 

contents:  
  Data directory --> contains .csv files of the planet parameters  
  Rmd directory --> contains the Rmarkdown file with the code to read in the data, reorganize it, and make plots  
  Plots directory --> contains the resulting plots  

Downloading the entire directory structure and opening the .Rproj file in Rstudio should allow running the code easily.
(all the required packages are called for in the first code block.  you will need to download and install these separately.  the Rstudio package manager makes it really easy though...)
